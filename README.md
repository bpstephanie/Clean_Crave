There is another link to the recipes page through the call-to-action button on the landing page image. This is for users who want to go straight to the recipes section.

## Design Choices

  - ### Typography 
    The fonts chosen were 'Merienda' for the main headings and 'Lato' for the text in the body. Their fall back fonts are cursive and sans-serif, respectively.
      * 'Merienda' was chosen for the headings to create an eye-catching title.
      * 'Lato' was chosen for its easy to read properties.
  
  - ### Colour Scheme
    The colour scheme chosen was green, beige and coral. Green was chosen for its healthy conotations. Clean Crave wants its users to know that the knowledge and recipes on the site are good for the users' wellbeing and health.
